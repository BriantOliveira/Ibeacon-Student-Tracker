Smart Room Attendance Monitoring and Location
Tracking with iBeacon Technology

Abstract
The objective of this project was to develop a system and a phone application using iBeacon
technology to track peopleâ€™s attendance and location at different types of events. This includes tracking
their location by using a location algorithm and receiving identifying information from each person
through the use of a phone application. This information will then be sent to a server for record keeping.
The project began with extensive data collection to determine the capabilities of the iBeacon
technology. We collected RSSI data based on different transmission powers and determined the correct
number, placement and the transmission power to ensure complete coverage.The location results for both of these was compared for accuracy using
Cramer-Rao.
The next part of the project depended upon the creation of a phone application that was capable of
detecting the signals from the iBeacon, collected data from the user of the application and sending this
information to a server. To accomplish this, the phone application was developed for an Android Phone
with Bluetooth Low Energy Capabilities. The application allows users to enter a username and password
and includes the ability to terminate the monitoring capabilities of the application. The data collected by
the phone application is sent to a text file stored within the offsite server Dropbox. This text file is accessed
by an Excel worksheet which imports the data and quantifies it for data representation and analysis.
